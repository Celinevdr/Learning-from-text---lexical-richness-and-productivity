# Learning-from-text---lexical-richness-and-productivity
I investigate the lexical diversity and productivity of small island developing states (SIDS), and more specifically those in the Pacific. To do this I use the UNGD corpus consisting of the state representives' speeches at the UN. I hypothesize that these states have a high incentive to deliver a powerful and engaging speech at the UN as this is one of the sole opportunities they get to make their voice heard at such a high-level platform. In addition, pacific island states have been known to target their speech towards a single issue that affects and will affect them most in the nearest future: climate change. Indeed, the consequences of climate change will determine the mere survival of these pacific islands who are directly threatened by rising sea levels. For the two reasons stated above I expect small pacific island states to deliver speeches containing a higher level of lexical richness and productivity in contrast to the average UN speeches.
